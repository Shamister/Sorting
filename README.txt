Sorting Test Program

The program implements any kind of main sorting algorithm, 
such as buble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort and tim sort.

By default, the program will use timSort to use sort the element.

To change it, just change the method name of it.
The comment inside the code will show it easily.
